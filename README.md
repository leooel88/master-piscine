# master-piscine

As part of my master's degree in computer science, I spent the 6 first weeks doing a *pool* (short but intense period during which computer science
students discover, or rediscover, the basics of the subject ), during which I achieved several projects, using several technologies (UNIX, BASH, C, HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL).

In this repository, I've stored the most interesting exercises I've carried out.
